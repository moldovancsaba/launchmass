---

## üöÄ Next Steps for Deployment

### Step 1: Version Bump (Required)

```bash
# Increment to 1.5.0 (MINOR version for new feature)
# Update in:
- package.json
- README.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md  
- All documentation references
```

**Rationale:** SSO integration is a significant new feature (MINOR bump), not a breaking change (MAJOR bump), per semantic versioning.

### Step 2: Create Release Notes

Add to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`:

```markdown
## [1.5.0] ‚Äî 2025-10-02T14:12:00.000Z

### üîê Security - SSO Integration (Breaking Change for Development)

**Added:**
- Complete SSO authentication via sso.doneisbetter.com
- Automatic user creation with admin rights on first login
- User persistence in MongoDB (`users` collection)
- Comprehensive audit logging (`authLogs` collection)
- Server-side session validation with SSR guard
- Client-side session monitoring (5-minute intervals)

**Changed:**
- Admin authentication now requires SSO login (no more ADMIN_TOKEN)
- All admin API routes protected with `withSsoAuth` middleware
- Admin UI shows user info and logout button
- App MUST run on *.doneisbetter.com subdomain (cookies requirement)

**Removed:**
- ADMIN_TOKEN environment variable (deprecated)
- Bearer token authentication system
- Token input field from admin interface

**Migration:**
- Run `node scripts/migrate-users-collection.cjs` after deployment
- Set SSO environment variables in Vercel
- Configure custom domain: launchmass.doneisbetter.com

**Note:** Localhost admin access no longer works due to cookie domain requirements.
Use Vercel preview deployments for testing.
```

### Step 3: Vercel Environment Variables

Set in Vercel Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:

```bash
# SSO Configuration
SSO_SERVER_URL=https://sso.doneisbetter.com
SSO_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.doneisbetter.com
SSO_LOGIN_PATH=/
SSO_LOGOUT_PATH=/logout

# Public env vars (for client-side)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_SERVER_URL=https://sso.doneisbetter.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_LOGIN_PATH=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_SSO_LOGOUT_PATH=/logout

# Existing (verify these are set)
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
DB_NAME=launchmass
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 4: Custom Domain Configuration

**Required:** Configure `launchmass.doneisbetter.com` in Vercel:

1. Go to Vercel Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add custom domain: `launchmass.doneisbetter.com`
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (~5 minutes)
5. Verify domain is active with HTTPS

**Critical:** Without this subdomain, SSO will not work!

### Step 5: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Option A: Via Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Option B: Git push (if auto-deploy enabled)
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): migrate to SSO authentication system ‚Äî v1.5.0"
git push origin main
```

### Step 6: Run Database Migration

After first deployment:

```bash
# SSH into Vercel deployment or run locally with production MONGODB_URI
node scripts/migrate-users-collection.cjs

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB
# ‚úÖ Unique index on { ssoUserId: 1 }
# ‚úÖ Index on { email: 1 }
# ‚úÖ Index on { createdAt: -1 }
# ‚úÖ Compound index on { ssoUserId: 1, createdAt: -1 }
# ‚úÖ Migration completed successfully!
```

**Note:** Safe to run multiple times (idempotent).

### Step 7: Verification Checklist

**On production (`launchmass.doneisbetter.com`):**

1. ‚úÖ Visit `/admin` without session
   - Should redirect to `sso.doneisbetter.com` login

2. ‚úÖ Complete SSO login
   - Should redirect back to admin interface
   - User name/email displayed in header

3. ‚úÖ Test admin operations
   - Create a new card ‚Üí Should succeed
   - Edit existing card ‚Üí Should succeed
   - Delete a card ‚Üí Should succeed
   - Drag-and-drop reorder ‚Üí Should succeed

4. ‚úÖ Check MongoDB
   - Find your user in `users` collection
   - Verify `isAdmin: true`
   - Check `authLogs` for login events

5. ‚úÖ Test logout
   - Click "Logout" button
   - Should redirect to SSO, then back to app
   - Next `/admin` visit should require login

6. ‚úÖ Verify DevTools (browser)
   - Network tab: No `Authorization: Bearer` headers
   - Cookies: SSO cookie with `Domain=.doneisbetter.com`
   - API calls include `credentials: include`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Localhost Development

**Admin features will NOT work on localhost** due to cookie domain mismatch.

**Solutions for testing admin features:**
1. Use Vercel preview deployments (recommended)
2. Set up dev subdomain: `dev-launchmass.doneisbetter.com`
3. Public pages (non-admin) work fine on localhost

### Breaking Changes

**For existing admins:**
- Old `ADMIN_TOKEN` no longer works
- Must create SSO account at `sso.doneisbetter.com`
- First SSO login automatically grants admin rights

**For development:**
- Localhost admin access removed (by design)
- Must use *.doneisbetter.com subdomain

### Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or restore ADMIN_TOKEN temporarily in Vercel env vars
# (Won't work long-term as code expects SSO)
```

Better: Keep v1.4.0 tag/branch as backup:

```bash
git tag v1.4.0-backup
git push --tags
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Infinite redirect loop to SSO"

**Symptoms:** Page keeps redirecting to SSO login and back  
**Cause:** App not on *.doneisbetter.com OR SSO cookies not being sent  
**Fix:**
1. Verify custom domain is `launchmass.doneisbetter.com`
2. Check Vercel deployment URL includes the domain
3. Clear browser cookies and try again
4. Verify SSL certificate is active

### "User not in props" error on admin page

**Symptoms:** TypeError about missing user property  
**Cause:** `getServerSideProps` not receiving user from SSO  
**Fix:**
1. Check `SSO_SERVER_URL` environment variable is set
2. Verify SSO service is reachable: `curl https://sso.doneisbetter.com/api/sso/validate`
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors

### "401 Unauthorized" on API calls

**Symptoms:** Card create/edit/delete operations fail with 401  
**Cause:** Session expired or cookies not included in request  
**Fix:**
1. Verify `credentials: 'include'` in all fetch calls (already implemented)
2. Check if session expired (logout and login again)
3. Review browser console for fetch errors

### MongoDB connection issues

**Symptoms:** Users not being created, auth logs not written  
**Cause:** MONGODB_URI not set or incorrect  
**Fix:**
1. Verify MONGODB_URI in Vercel environment variables
2. Check MongoDB Atlas network access whitelist
3. Test connection with migration script
