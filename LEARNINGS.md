# Development Learnings - launchmass v1.4.0

## Frontend

### Next.js Document Customization
**Issue**: Need to inject external scripts consistently across all application pages  
**Solution**: Implemented custom `_document.js` component for document-level modifications  
**Key Learning**: Next.js _document.js is the proper approach for global script injection, ensuring consistent loading across all pages without performance impact from individual page modifications

### Google Analytics Integration Pattern

### Conditional UI Rendering on Route
**Issue**: The global bottom info bar should not appear on admin pages  
**Solution**: In `pages/_app.js`, used `useRouter()` to detect `/admin` routes and conditionally suppress the info bar rendering, leaving CSS untouched  
**Key Learning**: Prefer route-based conditional rendering in the app wrapper for layout chrome that should vary by section; avoid putting dynamic UI in `_document.js` which is meant for static document structure

### Hashtags Feature Implementation (2025-09-16T18:12:51.000Z)
**Issue**: Need to support adding/removing hashtags on cards and filtering by hashtag on the main page  
**Solution**: Added `tags: string[]` to cards with strict normalization (trim, strip `#`, lowercase, dedupe). Implemented predictive tag input with chips and remove (x) on the admin page, and clickable chips on the main page with SSR filtering via `?tag=`. Provided `/api/tags` for distinct suggestions. Replaced MUI Autocomplete with a lightweight custom TagInput to avoid Popper-related build errors.  
**Key Learning**: Keep domain fields normalized at the API boundary; SSR query filtering yields stable, shareable URLs; avoid introducing heavy UI dependencies when a small bespoke input suffices for MVP stability.
**Issue**: Requirement to implement Google Analytics tracking with gtag.js  
**Solution**: Used Next.js _document.js with dangerouslySetInnerHTML for gtag initialization  
**Key Learning**: 
- Async script loading prevents render blocking
- dataLayer initialization must occur before gtag function definition
- Document-level injection ensures analytics coverage across all application routes
- Configuration object approach enables clean tracking ID management

## Process

### Versioning Protocol Application
**Issue**: Strict versioning requirements with specific increment rules  
**Solution**: Applied PATCH increment (1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1) before development work began  
**Key Learning**: Pre-development version increments ensure proper tracking of all development cycles, even before commit or deployment phases

### Documentation Framework Implementation
**Issue**: Multiple documentation files required with specific structural requirements  
**Solution**: Created comprehensive documentation suite following project governance rules  
**Key Learning**: 
- Documentation consistency prevents project fragmentation
- Forward-looking roadmaps require clear dependency tracking
- Task documentation must include specific ownership and delivery dates
- Architecture documentation should focus on current system state only

## Dev

### ES Module Compatibility
**Issue**: Project uses ES modules (type: "module" in package.json)  
**Solution**: All new code implemented with ES module syntax and imports  
**Key Learning**: Maintaining consistency with existing module system prevents import/export conflicts and ensures build stability

### Code Commenting Standards
**Issue**: Project requires comprehensive commenting explaining both function and reasoning  
**Solution**: Implemented detailed comments covering implementation decisions and architectural choices  
**Key Learning**: Comments should explain not just what code does, but why specific approaches were chosen, especially for architectural decisions like script injection methods
